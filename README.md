# Stockfish for Mac

Stockfish for Mac is a powerful chess analysis app. Play two-player games on the beautiful chess board, or get instant accurate analysis of any game.

# Project Status

Stockfish for Mac has been submitted to the Mac App Store. When it's released, it'll be available for free.

# Features

Stockfish for Mac has many of the essential features one would expect in a professional chess analysis application:

- Beautiful chess board with PDF graphics; automatically scales to any resolution
- Integrates with the Stockfish chess engine, but is generic enough to interface with any UCI chess engine
- Supports opening, viewing, and saving multi-game PGN files (strips out variations and commentary)
- Automatically detects and loads the right Stockfish binary based on CPU capabilities
- Can automatically adjust number of threads and hash size based on system capabilities
- Supports copying and pasting FEN strings, with validation

Some of the features Stockfish for Mac *does not* have:

- Chess clocks
- Opening books
- Variations and commentary
- Endgame tablebases
- Set up position
- Piece drag and drop
- etc.

Those features didn't make the 1.0.
